Description: This program is a practice with adapters in which a ToyBear object is adapted to use a Bear class function.

Needed Files: Program.cs
              ToyBear.cs
              Bear.cs
              TeddyBear.cs
              Grizzly.cs
              BearAdapter.cs

Design Decisions: I decided to print what functions were being used in main so that the actions are more clear to the user.
